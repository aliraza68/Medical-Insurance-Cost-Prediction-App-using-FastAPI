# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction Applicaiton

I have successfully performed EDA on medical-insurance-cost dataset and then trained RandomForest Regression moddel for insurance charges prediction. For the proof-of-concept, I have designed an application GUI using streamlit for user-interaction. In order to server precition, I have implemented a prediction API using FastAPI to serve model inference.
